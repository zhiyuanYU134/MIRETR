# ROBI_Toolkit
Python scripts to work on the ROBI dataset - a multi-view dataset for reflective objectsÂ in robotic bin-picking.\
ROBI dataset is available at: https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/robi.

# Requirements
Python >=3.5 \
opencv-python >= 3.1 \
numpy\
ruamel.yaml

# Baseline Methods
We provide the evaluation results on three object pose estimators (PPF [1], Line2D [2], AAE [3]), reasearchers are welcome to compare them against their our methods. The raw evaluation results can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ru3fmcYFBGOufGUp2jCkFaQgLCv7spIh/view?usp=sharing). Please run "**eval_baselines.py**" to load the the estimated object poses from these baseline approaches.

# Code
 * "**read_scene_imgs.py**": A script to load test images (with 6D camera poses and the ground truth 6D object poses).
 * "**read_pattern_imgs.py**": A script to load stereo pattern images and disparity maps. 
 * "**eval_baselines.py**": A script to load ground truth and the estimated object poses from provided baseline methods.

# Ground Truth Depth Map
Please note that, we capture the ground truth depth map with only Ensenso camera (no Realsense data). 
 * For Scene 4, 5, 8, 9, each viewpoint image has the corresponding GT depth map (in "GT_Depth" folder). 
 * For Scene 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, the GT depth maps were captured only for a subset of viewpoints in Ensenso data folder: 
   - **Scene 1-3**: DEPTH_view_{71-87}
   - **Scene 6-7**: DEPTH_view_{12-14, 16, 18, 22, 24-41}
